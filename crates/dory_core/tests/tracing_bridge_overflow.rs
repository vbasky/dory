/// Integration test for the tracing bridge overflow / drop counter.
///
/// Constructs a bridge with a tiny queue (capacity 4) and a slow fake sink that
/// blocks 20ms per record.  Fires 100 `tracing::warn!` events synchronously.
/// Asserts that the drop counter is positive (some events were dropped due to
/// queue overflow) and that the total is consistent (drops + drained ≈ fired).
///
/// Because `init_tracing` installs a global subscriber, this test runs in its
/// own binary (separate file) to avoid conflicts with `tracing_bridge_filter.rs`.
