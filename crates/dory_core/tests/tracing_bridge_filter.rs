/// Integration tests for the tracing bridge level filter gate.
///
/// These tests verify that `LevelCode` ordinals are consistent with the
/// expected gate semantics: TRACE/DEBUG are never passed to the audit layer,
/// INFO/WARN/ERROR are passed at or above the configured threshold, and the
/// threshold can be changed at runtime via `BridgeHandle::set_min_level`.
///
/// We test through the public `BridgeHandle` API rather than internal
/// `passes_level_gate` (which is `pub(crate)`).
