//! Release channel detected from the compiled crate version.
//!
//! The CI release pipeline stamps the workspace version before building, so the
//! version embedded in the binary already encodes the channel: `-nightly` for
//! rolling nightly builds, `-rc.N` for release candidates, and a plain
//! `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for stable. This module turns that single signal into the
//! channel-specific identity the runtime needs (window/app identifiers, display
//! name, and the on-disk database file).

/// The release channel a running build belongs to.
