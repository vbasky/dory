/**
 * Documentation for every published version.
 *
 * Files are materialised into `.versions/<version>/` from each version's git ref
 * before the collection loads, so the site can document several releases while
 * living on a single branch. Entry ids are `<version>/<page>` — the current
 * release is served unprefixed and the rest keep their version in the URL.
 *
 * The site never keeps its own copy of a document: the driver READMEs and the
 * architecture and contributing guides are read from the repository too, so a
 * change in behaviour and the paragraph describing it stay in one commit.
 *
 * Localized siblings live in the explicit docs directories from the locale
 * registry. Their generated ids use the canonical locale id, even when its
 * filesystem directory has different casing or spelling.
