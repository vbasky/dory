Dory takes the third option — one driver-neutral core, drivers that plug into it, and a UI that never learns the name of any of them.',

      'That constraint is enforced in the code, not in a style guide. The interface adapts through capability flags and metadata, so a document store gets a document view and a time-series store gets a range picker without a single branch on a driver name. Adding a database is writing a driver, not patching the app.',
